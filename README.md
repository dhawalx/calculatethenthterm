# calculatethenthterm
There is a series, , where the next term is the sum of pervious three terms. Given the first three terms of the series, , , and respectively, you have to output the nth term of the series using recursion.  Recursive method for calculating nth term is given below. S(n) = a if n=1; S(n) = b if n=2; S(n) = c if n=3; S(n) = S(n-1)+S(n-2)+S(n-3) if n otherwise  Print the nth term of the series, .
